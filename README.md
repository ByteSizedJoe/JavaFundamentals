# Java Fundamentals
A personal refresher on Java Fundamentals

## Basic Syntax
Based on C++ but simpler to prevent common programming mistakes. Every Java application starts with a class name, and the file name must match the class name. Java variables are used to store data, and they have different types such as int(integer), double(for decimal numbers), char (for characters), and boolean (for true/false)

## Data Types
Java is statically typed which means all variables must have a declared type at compile-time. Statically typed languages like Java include C++, Rust, C#. Dynamically typed languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby check the type at run-time instead of compile-time and the type of a variable could change at any time.

## Operators
Java supports a vast set of operators which help support operations such as arithmetic operations, logical operations, unary operations, assignment operations, bitwise operations,
