# Variables
Variables are locations in memory in which we can store data. Each variable has a data type that determines what kind of data it can store, how much space it takes up in memory, and what operations can be performed on it.

## Java has three main types of Variables:
###  Local Variables
Variables that are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks. Created when the method, constructor, or block is entered and destroyed when it is exited.

###  Instance Variables (Non-static fields)
Variables that are declared in a class but outside a method. When an Object of the class is created, each instance(Object) has its own copy of these variables.

###  Class Variables (Static fields)
Variables that are declared in a class but outside a method and marked with a "static" keyword. These variables are shared across all instances of a class.
