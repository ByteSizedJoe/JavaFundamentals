## Operators
Java supports a vast set of operators which help support operations such as arithmetic operations, logical operations, unary operations, assignment operations, bitwise operations,

### Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical operations:
- '+' addition
- '-' subtraction
- '*' multiplication
- '/' division
- '%' modulus/remainder

### Assignment Operators
Used for assigning values to variables
- '=' assignment 
- '+=' add and assign
- '-=' subtract and assign
- '*=' multiply and assign
- '/=' divide and assign
- '%=' modulus and assign
- '&=' bitwise AND and assign 
- '|=' bitwise OR and assign
- '^=' bitwise XOR and assign
- '>>=' bitwise right shift and assign
- '<<=' bitwise left shift and assign
- '>>>=' bitwise unsigned right shift and assign

### Ternary Operator
Used as short hand for if-else statement
- '? :' operator (boolean expression ? value if true : value if false)

### Unary Operator
Perform operations on a single operand
- '+' unary plus operator, indicates positive value
- '-' unary minus operator, indicates negative value
- '++' increment operator
- '--' decrement operator
- '!' logical complement operator

### Strings
The '+' operator is an arithmatic operator for addition but in the context of strings, it is used for string concatenation.
