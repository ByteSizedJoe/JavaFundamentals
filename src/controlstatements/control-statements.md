# Control Statements
Java control statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They are fundamental to programming in any language as they allow the program to behave differently based on given conditions and inputs and create complex execution paths and algorithms.

## Decision Making Statements
- 'if' statement: Used to test a condition, if the condition is true, the block inside the code of the if is executed.
- 'if-else' statement: Similar to 'if' statement but provides an alternative path of execution if the condition is false.
- 'switch' statement: Allows for any number of possible execution paths. It can be used instead of long complex 'if-else' statements

## Looping Statements
- 'for' loop: A loop that is used to advanced how every many times we need to execute a block of code.
- 'while' loop: Used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
- 'do-while' loop: Similar to 'while' loop but the condition is tested after the loop body is executed, which guarantees the loop body will always run at least once.

## Branching Statements
- 'break' statement: Used to terminate a loop or switch statement prematurely.
- 'continue' statement: Used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration.
- 'return' statement: Used to explicitly return from a method. It can also return a value to the caller of the method.
